  ```sql
  CREATE POLICY "One vote per user per poll" ON votes
    FOR INSERT WITH CHECK (
      NOT EXISTS (
        SELECT 1 FROM votes 
        WHERE poll_id = NEW.poll_id 
        AND user_id = auth.uid()
      )
    );
  ```

    userId: user?.id,
    resource: 'poll_delete',
    pollId: pollId,
    timestamp: new Date().toISOString(),
    userAgent: request.headers['user-agent'],
    ip: request.ip
  });
  ```
- [ ] **Log authentication events** (success/failure)
- [ ] **Track authorization failures**
- [ ] **Monitor rate limit violations**
